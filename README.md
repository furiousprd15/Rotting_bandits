## How to install and Run the project:
### Requirements(use pip install):
* Python >=3.7
* Numpy  >=1.2
* Matplotlib >=3.6


### Install and run the project:
* Clone the repository from github
* Open the terminal and and run command- `python3 RB_np.py`or the other files in the proper folder location
* If you have jupyter intsalled run the code in the jupyter terminal for convienience


### Project Structure

1. `RB_np.py` - python file containing the SWA and w-SWA algorithms for the parametric cases

### Project Description:
We consider a variant of the MAB framework, which we termed Rotting Bandits, where each armâ€™s expected reward decays as a function of the number of times it has been pulled. We are motivated by many real-world scenarios such as online advertis- ing, content recommendation, crowdsourcing, and more. We present algorithms, accompanied by simulations, and derive theoretical guarantees.
